The notebook is well-organized and easy to follow. The author selected the following features for modeling: 'age', 'bmi', 'children', 'sex_male', 'smoker_yes', 'region_northwest', 'region_southeast', and 'region_southwest', with 'charges' as the target variable. It appears they used all available features in the dataset, which can be beneficial for predictions. However, using too many features could potentially impact the model’s performance due to overfitting.

That said, the selected features make sense, as they have a logical relationship with the target variable. The results and model comparisons are clearly explained and easy to interpret. The notebook effectively demonstrates how preprocessing steps like scaling and feature expansion can significantly improve a regression model’s accuracy and robustness. Additionally, they provided valuable insights to help contextualize the data and results.

The only recommendation for improvement would be a final review of the text formatting some cells have awkward spacing, and there’s an unused markdown cell that could be cleaned up. Overall, it's a solid and informative project.
